NFT Data Analysis Project ðŸš€

Over the past 18 months, the world has witnessed the emergence of a groundbreaking technology - Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). These digital assets, stored on the blockchain, garnered immense attention, with over $22 billion spent last year on their acquisition. Despite controversies surrounding scams and environmental concerns, the potential for profit in NFTs is evident. In this project, we delve into the realm of NFTs, focusing on the sales data of the iconic Cryptopunks project.

The project encompasses diverse objectives, ranging from determining the total number of sales during the specified time period to unveiling insights into the most expensive transactions. We aim to provide a comprehensive analysis, including details like NFT names, ETH prices, USD prices, and transaction dates. The exploration extends to generating transaction data with a moving average, unveiling average sale prices per NFT, and offering statistics on sales categorized by the day of the week.

One intriguing aspect is the creation of a sale summary, encapsulating the essence of each transaction - from the NFT name to the buyer, seller, date, and USD price. We also address specific queries, such as creating a view for purchases made by a particular wallet and crafting an ETH price histogram for visualization. The project culminates in exploring the highest and lowest prices for each NFT, identifying monthly/yearly top-selling NFTs, calculating total monthly sales volume, and analyzing the transaction count for a specific wallet.
